An unknown game of unknown design.

# game design ideas
- most games start out with the characters having limited abilities and gaining more throughout; this game should start out with the game having limited features features and gain more throughout -- monochrome -> colour, 8-bit -> 3D, poor resolution to high definition, bleeps and bloops -> orchestrated
- effects on character should effect gameplay mechanics: main character is blinded -> blurry or black screen; stunned -> mouse or keyboard input disabled
- i like the Legend of Mana technique system: pressing jump and crouch (two actions on two different controls) performs highjump -> repeated performance unlocks high jump as singular action -> high jump now assignable as one action on one control
- alchemy the mobile game has simple mechanic of combining earth, water, air, and fire into higher order items: one action, 4 elements -> rich, complex combination system
- most games have a party where everyone contributes to fighting: this game shall put emphasis on parties with defenseless but useful members -- a crafter, scout, monster expert, and warrior, where the warrior has to attack enemies and defend everyone else
- players should be ignorant unless they learn through playing: this game should have no numbers, healthbars, or any indication of game mechanics
- related to previous rules: in this game, allowing players to see indications of game mechanics (damage, health points, durability, etc.) should require them to achieve some related skill first
- this game should encourage rest; limit the amount of time players can play; rewards for playing are only given while not playing, e.g. a player builds up potential skill points while playing, but only are given the skill points while they aren't playing
